# Project2 Words in Motion

song reused and rearranged by Maika Ye

<h1>Overview</h1>

This Song is a representation of what community meant: Belonging. Crows, especially in China, are seen as a bad omen and
brings in bad luck. However in this song, it is seen in the perspective of the crow and how they felt. The crow is a symbol for outcasts in society and how they have equal rights to belong in a community just as much as anyone else.
