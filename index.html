        You're too perfect, highlighting that I'm in all black
 Even if I stay silent, disdained rejections are like shattering stones into bits
 Unable to fly while wearing wings, getting cold looks, no one offers to help 
What I lack is grace and elegance 
I despise being ashamed of feeling inferior 
My heart has been crushed, I calmly face it, being honest is tear-jerking

 The most sorrowful thing is that encounters are regarded as a waste
 Not a black sheep but yet classified as one 
Wandering alone on the streets 
Disregarding the stares 
All the crows in the world are black 
But they are not heartless 
Love is neither inferior or superior, crows can fly bravely for love too
